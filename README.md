# QueryHelper.cfc

by [Ben Nadel][1]

**NOTE**: While this project will have some actual programming utility to it, 
I have created QueryHelper.cfc primarily as a means to test my [Tiny Test][2]
unit-testing framework and to learn more about Test Driven Development (TDD)
in general.

QueryHelper.cfc is a ColdFusion query wrapper that provides high-level utility
methods for working with and manipulating ColdFusion queries.
